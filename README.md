# Learning to Program with Python 3  

## About This Repository  
This repository documents my journey in learning Python, with a focus on developing the programming skills needed for data analysis. My ultimate goal is to apply these skills to conduct research on Rockstar Games, GTA 6, and the video game industry as a whole.  

By mastering Python, I will be able to analyze industry trends, player retention, pricing strategies, and financial models. These are crucial for understanding the long-term sustainability of the gaming industry.
