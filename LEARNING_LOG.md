## Lesson 1: Introduction to Python 3
- Learned string command.

## Lesson 2: Tuples, Strings, and Loops
- Tuples are immutable sequences used to store multiple values in a single variable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after assignment.
- Strings (revisited) handle text-based data.
- Loops (forloops specifically) simplify iteration over sequences, which is easier to process multiple times.
